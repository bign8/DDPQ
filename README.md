Disk Deferred Priority Queue in Python

## Reasons
Have you ever wanted to search through a space of `2^30` nodes but found your regular A* search algorithm overfilled memory?
Well grieve no more, as the disk deferred priority queue is here and ready for business!

### TODO

- Actually test this thing
- Add other Disk Deferred data structures
  - Stack, Queue, DeQueue, etc...
- Have some fun!!!
- Cover with some generative tests
